# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository containing only a README.md file. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase with no established codebase, build system, or development workflow yet.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Basic project documentation with title "test_app1"
- No source code directories or files present
- No configuration files for build tools, package managers, or development environments

## Development Setup

Currently, there are no package managers, build tools, or development dependencies configured. The repository is essentially empty and ready for initial project setup.

## Notes for Future Development

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to include:
- Build and test commands
- Code architecture and patterns
- Development workflow instructions
- Any specific project conventions or guidelines
